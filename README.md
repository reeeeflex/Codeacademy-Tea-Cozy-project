## Codeacademy Tea Cozy Open Project

Codeacademy's open project for their Full-Stack Engineer Career Path course.

- In this project we were supposed to style a website using the provided images and design spec. We had to use all our resources, Google, MDN, stackoverflow, etc. As well as the information learned throughout the course to create from scratch and style a landing page to make it look like the design spec provded.
- I used flex a lot of flex and divs, along with semantic html to make it more readable and easier to maintain.
